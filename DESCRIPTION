Description: We implement adaptive estimation of the joint density linear model where the coefficients - intercept and slopes - are random and independent from regressors which support is a proper subset. The estimator proposed in Gaillac and Gautier (2019) <arXiv:1905.06584> is based on Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions which are computed  efficiently in 'RandomCoefficients'. This package also provides a parallel implementation of the estimator.
